# Swear Jar


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisities

If you haven't yet, you'll need to [install node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then you'll need to install gulp. If you haven't already, enter from terminal (skip this if you do have gulp installed):

```sh
$ npm install --global gulp
```

Finally, `cd` into the project folder and do:

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Installing

With npm and gulp installed, you're good to go. To compile the source files into `dist` run:

```sh
$ gulp
```

For development, you can compile the files and view the project in your browser as you make changes at http://localhost:3000/ by running:

```sh
$ gulp serve
```

This will serve the site using local files in the `app` directory, as well as a generated `.tmp` directory. To view the site using compiled files in the `dist` directory, you can do:

```sh
$ gulp serve:dist
```

the `dist` directory is the final directory to be compiled and deployed to production.
